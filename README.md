An Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is a device that converts an analog signal (continuous in time and amplitude) into a corresponding digital signal (discrete in time and amplitude). The digital representation of the analog input signal enables the 8086 microprocessor to process and analyze the data in its digital domain.
Key Concepts in ADC
Analog Signal:

A continuous signal that varies over time.
Examples include sound, light intensity, or temperature signals.
Digital Signal:

A discrete representation of the analog signal, typically represented in binary form.
Operation of ADC:

The ADC samples the analog signal at regular intervals and converts each sample into a binary value proportional to the signal's amplitude.
Components of an ADC System
ADC Device:

Converts the input analog signal to a digital signal. Examples include ADC0804 (8-bit ADC) or ADC1210 (12-bit ADC).
8086 Microprocessor:

A 16-bit microprocessor used for interfacing and processing digital data.
Operates in either minimum mode (single microprocessor) or maximum mode (multiprocessor).
Clock Source:

Provides the clock pulses required for ADC operation and synchronization.
Control Signals:

Start of Conversion (SOC): Triggers the ADC to begin converting the analog signal.
End of Conversion (EOC): Indicates the completion of the conversion process.
I/O Ports:

Data lines for transferring digital data from ADC to the microprocessor.
Working of ADC with 8086 Microprocessor
Input Signal:

The analog signal (e.g., voltage) is applied to the ADC's input.
Start of Conversion:

The 8086 sends a control signal (SOC) to the ADC to initiate the conversion process.
Analog to Digital Conversion:

The ADC samples the analog signal and converts it into a binary value proportional to the signal amplitude.
End of Conversion:

When the conversion is complete, the ADC sets the EOC signal high, indicating the data is ready.
Data Transfer:

The 8086 reads the digital data from the ADC's output lines through its I/O ports.
The data is then processed or stored in memory as required.
Interfacing ADC with 8086
The interface between the ADC and the 8086 microprocessor includes:

Control Lines:

SOC and EOC signals are generated by the microprocessor or additional hardware logic.
Data Bus:

ADC output lines are connected to the 8086's data bus.
Address Decoding:

Ensures the ADC's control and data registers are mapped to specific I/O addresses.
Clock Input:

Provides the necessary clock pulses for ADC operation.
